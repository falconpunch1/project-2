            <h1>FLOSS Software</h1>
            <p>I'm very much a support of free libre open source software.</p>
            <p>What that means, in simple terms is any software that abides by the following 4 essential freedoms, those being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
                <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Having access to the source code is a prerequisite for this.</li>
                <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others. </li>
                <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing so, people will have the collective freedom to be able to pick and chose their software, regardless of technical knowledge.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hearing that, I hope you have a slightly better understanding of what I am referring to when I mention FLOSS.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this principle is that people should be able to know what they're running, be able to modify their software, and be able to share their contributions to anyone around the world. Right now, that's not the case for a lot of programs out there.</p>
            <p>If the biggest problem was over control, that would be one thing in and of itself, but there are serious connotations involved with not being in control of what you are running. Take for instance surveillance capitalism, or having malicious code being executed without your knowledge, among others. There are real risks involved with dabbling in proprietary software.</p>
            <p>Personally, I try to do my best to avoid proprietary software. Of course, I still use it. I require it for education, I require it for keeping in touch with friends and family, and I use it for myself (namely banking, but there are others). Despite that, however, I do see the values in utilizing FLOSS whenever you can and I do what I can to migrate whenever I can. It's unrealistic, but dare I say, I would also like it if others around me adopted similar mentalities, and disengaged from proprietary software as well.</p>
            <p>I've been going on a bit of a ramble, so I'll end it off here, but this topic is quite wide ranging, there are many aspects from its pros and its cons, to the other reasons why one would look to move in this direction, and why one may not be able to go "all the way" so to speak.</p>
