            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a very motivated student passionate about personal computing and the dangers associated with it. My goals are to level up my knowledge, so I can better make use of my computing needs, and to be able to lend a hand to others that have a need to secure their organization, information, or anything else that falls under the jurisdiction of cybersecurity. Furthermore, if I can make it harder for malicious actors to prey on people, it will be a good step to making the web a safer place to be in.</p>

            <h2>Educational History</h2>
            <p>Sophomore at Illinois Institute of Technology, studying Information Technology and Applied Cybersecurity</p>
            <p>As it stands right now, I've completed/working towards the following relevant courses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object-oriented programming 1 and 2</li>
                <li>Intro to OS and Hardware 1</li>
                <li>Intro to Open Source Development</li>
                <li>Intro to Web Development</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Familiarity with Linux</li>
                <li>Hobbyist level knowledge in computing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
            <p>I am able to speak in both English and Spanish, alongside the aforementioned programming languages. Having this should help make me more versatile and able to work with larger groups of people.</p>

            <h2>Current Goals</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, right now my main goal is to attain as much experience I can as possible, and I can do that in a couple ways. I have had plans to run Gentoo on my laptop. This will help me have a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind what makes up an operating system. Further, I would also achieve my secondary aims at integrating closer to FLOSS.</p>
            <p>In addition to that, I will be having access to a private datacenter sometime by the end of next semester. My hopes are to leverage it to gain experience in server maintenance and security, alongside some courses from services such as Hack the Box, among other reputable ones.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it would also be good for me to begin self-studying networking, as it is a field I will likely be learning about if not this upcoming semester, the one that follows. Given the nature of what I want to do and what my major requires of me, it would be prudent to start getting to work on what is likely my biggest foundational knowledge.</p>
